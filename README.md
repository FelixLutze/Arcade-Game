# Arcade Game

The goal of the game is to control a figure without colliding with any bugs. You control the figure with the arrow keys of your keyboard. The player will get a reward in points once he reaches the water. If you get hit 5 times, a game over screen will appear to Display your Score. Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
