# Arcade Game

The goal of the game is to control a character without colliding with any bugs. 
You control the figure with the arrow keys of your keyboard. 

Once the player reaches the water, the game score increases.

If you collide with a bug for the fifth time, a game over screen will appear to display the final score.
